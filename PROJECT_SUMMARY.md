### 1. **Fully Customized Chapter 1: "How We Met"**
The story now reflects your real relationship:

- ✅ First message: **"Filo?"** 
- ✅ Her smooth line: **"If I say 'ampogi,' what ethnicity would you think I am?"**
- ✅ **King's Day in the Netherlands** context
- ✅ Inside joke: **"umiikot ung mundo ko"** (when she's tipsy)
- ✅ Your song: **"Too Good to Say Goodbye — Bruno Mars"**
- ✅ Breakup-and-back-together theme (handled gently and lovingly)
- ✅ Photo will display at `assets/us.jpg` in the rooftop scene

## 📁 Final Project Structure

```

├── index.html       ← Mobile-first HTML structure
├── styles.css       ← Beautiful, responsive styling
├── game.js          ← Your customized story + game logic
├── README.md        ← GitHub Pages deployment instructions
└── assets/

```

## 📸 Next Step: Add Your Photo

1. Find a nice photo of you and Nycie
2. Save it as `us.jpg`
3. Place it in the `assets/` folder
4. The photo will appear in the romantic rooftop scene (Scene 7)

If you don't have a photo yet, that's okay! The game will work fine without it—the image just won't display.

## 🚀 Publishing to GitHub Pages

Follow the instructions in [README.md](README.md):

1. Create a GitHub repository
2. Push your code:
   ```bash
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Our Story - Valentine's Day Game"
   git branch -M main
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPO-NAME.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```
3. Enable GitHub Pages in Settings → Pages
4. Share the URL with Nycie! 💕

## 🎮 Testing Locally

Simply open `index.html` in your browser to test everything before publishing!

## 💕 The Final Valentine Message

When Nycie reaches the end and clicks "So... will you be my Valentine? 💕", she'll see:

> "Nycie, from that first message to this moment, every day with you has been a gift. We've been through so much together – the fun times, the hard times, and everything in between. And I wouldn't change a thing because it all led us here.
>
> You're my favorite person, my inside joke keeper, my 'ampogi' flirt, the one who makes my world spin (umiikot ung mundo ko, right? 😊). You're the person I want to keep making memories with, the one I want to share every Bruno Mars song with, the one I choose every single day.
>
> So, Nycie... will you be my Valentine? 💕
>
> — CJ"

**Made with 💕 for an amazing Valentine's Day surprise!**
